Project Vision

For fitness freaks who like to keep track of their daily routine the WellTrack application is a software-based application that allows its users to keep track of their sleep REM cycle, calorie intake, amount of water to consume and notify the user about it. Unlike fitness applications like Fitbit or Hydro Coach which focus on general fitness and water intake tracking respectively, our product not only offers those features combined but also enables the users to schedule and view their healthcare appointments directly from the app at their desired facility and get reminders in their calendar. It provides an all-in-one package for people who generally want to keep track of their routine and helps maintain a healthy lifestyle.
